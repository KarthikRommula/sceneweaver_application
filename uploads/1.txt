Script 1: The Argument
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The room is dimly lit. A cold breeze flows in through the open window. Two people, JAMES and LUCY, stand facing each other, their breaths visible in the frigid air. Tension fills the room.

JAMES
You never listen, Lucy. All I’ve ever wanted is for us to be a family.

LUCY
(angrily)
And all I’ve ever wanted is to feel heard. But you don’t see me, do you, James?

JAMES
What is it that you want me to see? Your never-ending complaints? Your constant... discontent?

LUCY
(voice breaking)
I want you to see me, not just the person who cleans up after you, who holds everything together while you... you just fall apart!

She starts to walk away, but James grabs her arm.

JAMES
Don’t walk away. You think this is easy for me? We both have our demons, Lucy. But we’re supposed to fight them together.

LUCY
(quietly, defeated)
We haven’t fought together in years.
