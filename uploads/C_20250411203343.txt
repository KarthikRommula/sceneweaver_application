Script 3: A Fractured Brotherhood
[Setting: A decrepit warehouse filled with broken machinery. Alex finds Jordan hiding.]

Alex: (shouting) Come out, Jordan. I’m done playing hide-and-seek.
Jordan: (stepping out) You don’t want this fight, Alex.
Alex: Oh, I do. After what you did, I’ve been waiting for it.
Jordan: (sighing) It wasn’t personal. It was business.
Alex: Business? You sold out our family!
Jordan: (angrily) Don’t you dare lecture me about family. Where were you when I needed help?
Alex: I was cleaning up your messes, as always.
Jordan: And I’m done with that. I’m done with you.
Alex: (raises fists) Too bad. You don’t get to walk away.
[Jordan grabs a crowbar and swings it. Alex dodges and counters with a wrench. Sparks fly as the weapons clash.]
Jordan: You’re as stubborn as ever.
Alex: And you’re as selfish as ever.
[Alex disarms Jordan and holds the crowbar to his throat.]
Alex: (gritting teeth) This ends here.
Jordan: (whispering) Go ahead, then. Finish it.
[Alex hesitates, allowing Jordan to escape.]
