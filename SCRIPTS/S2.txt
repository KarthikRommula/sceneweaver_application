Script 2: Breaking Point
Setting: A remote cabin in the woods, where the tension between two former allies has reached a breaking point. One holds a gun, and the other is trying to reason.

Character 1: (Holding the gun firmly, voice cold)
"You thought I wouldn’t find out, didn’t you? You think you can just walk away and leave me in the dust?"

Character 2: (Nervously)
"I never meant to hurt you! I made a mistake, but I’m not the person you think I am. Please, put the gun down. We can fix this."

Character 1: (Laughing bitterly)
"Fix this? You can’t fix betrayal. Once you cross that line, there’s no going back."

Character 2: (Frantic)
"I’m sorry. I was wrong. But this isn’t you! This isn't who you are! You don’t have to end it this way."
