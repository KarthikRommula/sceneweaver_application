Script 3: The Argument
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The room is heavy with silence, broken only by the distant hum of traffic outside. JAMES and LUCY stand across from each other, both emotionally exhausted.

JAMES
Why can’t you just admit it? We’re falling apart, and you’re doing nothing to fix it!

LUCY
(tears in her eyes)
I’ve been trying, James! I’ve been trying to hold this all together, but you—
(she gestures wildly)
You act like nothing’s wrong!

JAMES
(shouting now)
Because I don’t know what else to do! I can’t keep fighting for this alone!

LUCY
(turning away)
Then maybe you should stop. Maybe it’s time for both of us to stop pretending.

She walks toward the door. James stands frozen, a single tear falling down his cheek.

JAMES
(softly)
I’m not ready to give up, Lucy. Are you?
