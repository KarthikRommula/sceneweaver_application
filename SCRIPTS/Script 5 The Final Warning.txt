Script 5: The Final Warning
The warehouse is damp, with water dripping from the ceiling. Riley leans against a crate as Sam stammers his story.

Sam: (panicking) I didn’t mean to. It was just one time. I didn’t know it’d go this far.
Riley: (coldly) And now people are dead, Sam. You’re an accomplice.

Sam breaks down, sobbing.

Sam: (pleading) You don’t know what they’re capable of!
Riley: (shaking her head) Then why’d you play their game?

The sound of slow clapping interrupts them. A figure steps into the faint light.

The Shadow: (mockingly) Bravo. A real heart-to-heart moment. Too bad it’s your last one.

Riley raises her gun, but the shadow moves too quickly, vanishing again.

Riley: (yelling) Show yourself!

Sam grabs her arm, trembling.

Sam: (whispering) We’ve got to run. Now.
