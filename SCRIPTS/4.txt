Script 4: The Argument
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The room is chilly, the only warmth coming from the light of a flickering lamp. JAMES and LUCY stand at opposite ends, their bodies tense, their minds miles apart.

JAMES
I don’t know how to fix this anymore. It’s like we’re just... two strangers living under the same roof.

LUCY
(bitterly)
You’ve never tried, James. You just walk around, acting like everything’s fine when you know it’s not. I can’t keep doing this.

JAMES
(angry)
I’m trying to fix it! I don’t know what you want me to do. You’re always complaining, but you never say what you need!

LUCY
(tears threatening to fall)
I don’t need you to fix everything. I need you to see me. To listen. To actually care.

There is a long, painful silence. James takes a step forward.

JAMES
I care, Lucy. But I need you to let me in. Let me in, just once.

Lucy looks at him, but shakes her head, overwhelmed by the pain.

LUCY
I don’t know how much longer I can keep pretending either.
