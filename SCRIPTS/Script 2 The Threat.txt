Script 2: The Threat
Detective Riley stands calmly while Sam paces, his breathing ragged. The air is tense, and the only light comes from a swinging bulb above.

Riley: (calm but firm) Sit down, Sam. Your fidgeting is giving me a headache.
Sam: (shaking his head) You don’t get it. They have eyes everywhere.

From the shadows, a faint clicking sound is heard, like a boot tapping against concrete.

Riley: (lowering her voice) Someone’s here.
Sam: (whispering frantically) You said this place was safe!

Riley: (clutching her gun) And it is. Unless you’re lying to me. Did you bring someone here?

A shadow moves closer, the faint outline of a figure with a cigarette glowing in the dark.

The Shadow: (mockingly) Funny, isn’t it? Trusting the wrong people.

Sam freezes, his face pale. Riley turns to face the shadow, her gun raised.
