Script 1: Betrayal Unmasked
[Setting: A dimly lit alley. Rain pours heavily as Alex confronts Jordan.]

Alex: You thought I wouldn’t find out, didn’t you?
Jordan: I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Alex: Don’t play dumb! You sold us out to the Faction!
Jordan: (gripping a knife) Watch your mouth. You’re walking a thin line.
Alex: Thin line? You crossed it the moment you stabbed us in the back.
Jordan: I had no choice! They would’ve killed me.
Alex: And now, because of you, they’re hunting us all.
Jordan: (shouting) Don’t you dare judge me! You have no idea what I’ve been through.
Alex: (lunges forward) Maybe I don’t, but I know betrayal when I see it!
[They exchange blows. Alex punches Jordan; Jordan slashes with the knife, grazing Alex’s arm.]
Jordan: (panting) Walk away, Alex. You don’t have to die for this.
Alex: (gritting teeth) You’re right—I’m not dying here. But you might.
[Alex tackles Jordan, pinning them against the wall. A brief struggle ensues before Jordan escapes.]
