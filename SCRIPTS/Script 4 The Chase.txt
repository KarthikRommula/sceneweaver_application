Script 4: The Chase
The warehouse is eerily silent as Riley and Sam enter. Sam clutches a folder tightly.

Riley: (whispering) This better be worth it.
Sam: (nervously) It’s all here. Names, dates, shipments. But we’ve got to get out of here—

Suddenly, the sound of running footsteps echoes. A shadow bolts past a stack of crates.

Riley: (whisper-shouting) Stay here.

Riley draws her gun and moves stealthily toward the sound. Sam crouches, trembling. A low voice whispers in the dark.

The Shadow: (mocking) Clever move, Detective. But not clever enough.

Riley spins, but the figure is gone. Behind her, Sam screams.

Sam: (terrified) No! Stay away!

Riley rushes back to find Sam gone, the folder open and empty.
