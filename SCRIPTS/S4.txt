Script 4: Crossing the Line
Setting: A deserted street, headlights from a parked car casting long shadows. One character is aiming a weapon, and the other is trying to reason with them.

Character 1: (Angrily)
"You had your chance, and you wasted it. Now I have to make sure you don’t hurt anyone else."

Character 2: (Desperate, voice shaky)
"I never meant to hurt anyone! I was just trying to survive! I don’t want to end up like this—please, you have to understand!"

Character 1: (Cold, determined)
"Survival? You think you’re the only one trying to survive? You’ve betrayed me, and there’s no coming back from that."

Character 2: (Trying to step closer, voice softening)
"You’re better than this. You know it. This isn’t who you were when we started. Don’t throw everything away for revenge."
