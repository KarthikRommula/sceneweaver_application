Script 4: A Deal Gone Wrong
[Setting: An abandoned train station. Jordan is waiting with a briefcase when Alex storms in.]

Alex: You really thought I wouldn’t track you down?
Jordan: (calmly) Thought you’d be smarter than this.
Alex: Smarter? You mean like selling out your friends for some cash?
Jordan: (shrugs) Friends don’t pay the bills.
Alex: (snarling) They trusted you, and you turned them in!
Jordan: (drawing a knife) Trust gets you killed, Alex. Remember that.
Alex: (draws a chain) Maybe you need a reminder of what loyalty looks like.
[They clash violently, Alex swinging the chain while Jordan counters with the knife.]
Jordan: (taunting) Is that all you’ve got?
Alex: (grinning) Not even close.
[Alex trips Jordan, pinning him to the ground. The knife slides away.]
Jordan: (laughing weakly) You’re too soft to finish this.
Alex: (punching) Maybe I was. Not anymore.
