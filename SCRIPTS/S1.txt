Script 1: Final Decision
Setting: A dimly lit alley, rain pouring down. The two characters face each other, with one holding a knife and the other desperately trying to calm the situation.

Character 1: (Breathing heavily, holding the knife)
"You think you can talk your way out of this? It's too late. You’ve pushed me to this point."

Character 2: (Voice trembling but trying to stay composed)
"I never meant for any of this to happen! We can still fix things. Put the knife down, and we can talk this through."

Character 1: (Eyes narrowing, voice dripping with anger)
"Talk? What’s there left to talk about? You've betrayed me, and now you think words will save you?"

Character 2: (Shaking, backing away slightly)
"Please, listen to me! You’re not a killer. You’re better than this. Don’t let this be the end of everything."
