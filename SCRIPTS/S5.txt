Script 5: Last Words
Setting: A darkened alley at night, the moonlight casting shadows across the two characters. One holds a bat, the other standing defenseless.

Character 1: (Snarling, holding the bat tightly)
"You think you can just walk away from all the damage you’ve caused? You’re not getting out of here, not like this."

Character 2: (Trying to keep calm, hands trembling)
"I’m not proud of what I did, but I never wanted this. Let me make it right—just put the bat down, and we’ll figure something out."

Character 1: (Eyes wild with anger)
"You had your chance to make things right. But now, you’ve crossed the line, and I’m not going to let you off that easy."

Character 2: (With conviction, voice shaking)
"You don’t have to do this. It doesn’t have to end like this. You’re not a monster—you’re a person who can still choose the right path."
