Script 3: The Ultimatum
Setting: A rooftop at sunset, the city lights twinkling below. One character has a gun pointed at the other, both caught in a web of mistrust and betrayal.

Character 1: (Voice low and threatening)
"You think you can play both sides and walk away? You’re wrong. I’m not letting you get away with it."

Character 2: (Hands raised in surrender, voice pleading)
"Please, you have to believe me. I never intended for things to go this far. I’ve made mistakes, but this isn’t the solution."

Character 1: (Fists clenched, rage evident)
"You’ve been lying to me for months. How do you think this ends? There’s no going back from this."

Character 2: (Tears in eyes, voice breaking)
"This isn’t who I am! I swear, I’ll make things right, just please—don’t do this. Don’t become the monster you’re chasing."
