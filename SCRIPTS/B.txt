[Setting: A rooftop overlooking the city. Alex confronts Jordan, who’s holding a suitcase of stolen cash.]

Alex: That’s a lot of blood money you’ve got there, Jordan.
Jordan: (smirking) It’s called survival. Something you wouldn’t understand.
Alex: Survival? You killed your own team for it!
Jordan: They were liabilities. Weak. Just like you.
Alex: (steps closer) Say that again, I dare you.
Jordan: (pulls a gun) Careful, Alex. This can end badly for you.
Alex: Guns don’t scare me. Your cowardice does.
Jordan: (laughs) Big words for someone with nothing left to lose.
Alex: You’re wrong. I still have justice.
[Alex throws a metal pipe at Jordan, knocking the gun aside. They charge at each other, exchanging punches and kicks.]
Jordan: (spitting blood) This won’t change anything!
Alex: (pinning Jordan) It’ll change you being a threat.
[Alex smashes the suitcase, scattering cash into the wind. Jordan escapes into the shadows.]
