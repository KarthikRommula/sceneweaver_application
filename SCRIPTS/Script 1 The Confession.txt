Script 1: The Confession
The scene opens with Detective Riley pacing the cold, dusty floor of the warehouse. Sam, jittery and sweating, stands near a flickering lightbulb.

Riley: (sternly) You called me here, Sam. Start talking.
Sam: (stammering) I... I shouldn’t even be here. They’ll kill me if they find out I told you anything.
Riley: (leaning closer) And they’ll definitely kill you if you don’t. Clock’s ticking.

Sam looks over his shoulder nervously. The sound of distant footsteps echoes through the warehouse.

Sam: (whispering) It was the shipment. Last Tuesday. I saw…
Riley: (interrupting) What did you see? Who was there?

Suddenly, a metal pipe clatters to the floor in the shadows. Both freeze.

Riley: (drawing a gun) We’re not alone.

A shadow moves in the corner, barely visible. Sam panics.

Sam: (whisper-shouting) It’s them! They found me!
