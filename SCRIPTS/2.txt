Script 2: The Argument
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The dim light flickers above. The wind outside howls as JAMES and LUCY stare at each other. Their eyes burn with the weight of unspoken words.

JAMES
You think I don’t care? You think I don’t want this to work?

LUCY
(sarcastically)
You want it? You just don’t try for it. There’s a difference.

JAMES
(frustrated)
What do you want from me, Lucy? Every time I try, you shut me out.

LUCY
You don’t try. You think fixing things means saying the right words, but it’s more than that. It’s action. It’s listening.

JAMES
(steps closer, softer)
I’m listening now. What do you need?

LUCY
I need you to stop pretending. Stop pretending everything’s fine when it’s not. Stop pretending we’re okay when we’re not.

The air between them thickens, as if the room itself is holding its breath.
