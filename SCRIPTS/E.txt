Script 5: Blood and Shadows
[Setting: A dense forest under the moonlight. Alex chases Jordan, who is wounded.]

Alex: You can’t run forever, Jordan!
Jordan: (panting) Better than facing your self-righteous speeches.
Alex: (cornering Jordan) You betrayed us all for your greed.
Jordan: (drawing a dagger) And I’d do it again. Survival’s a cruel game.
Alex: (unsheathes a knife) Then let’s play.
[They engage in a brutal knife fight, slashing and parrying. Blood stains the ground.]
Jordan: (wincing) You think this changes anything?
Alex: (gritting teeth) It changes you not hurting anyone else.
Jordan: (smirking) You’ll never stop the Faction.
Alex: (delivers a final blow, disarming Jordan) I’ll stop them and everyone like you.
[Alex walks away as Jordan collapses, defeated.]
